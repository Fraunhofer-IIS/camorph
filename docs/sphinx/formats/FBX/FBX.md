# FBX

FBX is a proprietary file format by Autodesk. Because of this, there is little information publicly available.

## Coordinate System

The coordinate system in FBX can be set individually for each FBX file.
The standard definition is y-up, x-right,
z-front and the default camera orientation is x-front
y-up

## File Structure

Blender published their findings for the binary file structure of an FBX file in a [blogpost](https://code.blender.org/2013/08/fbx-binary-file-format-specification/) in 2014.
